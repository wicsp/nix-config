# Kubernetes Clusters

> WIP, not finished yet.

I'm running two Kubernetes clusters, one for production and one for testing.

I prefer to use [k3s] as the Kubernetes distribution, because it's lightweight, easy to install, and
full featured(see [what-have-k3s-removed-from-upstream-kubernetes] for details).

## KubeVirt Cluster

The KubeVirt cluster is running on physical machines, all my virtual machines are running on this
cluster, including other Kubernetes clusters.

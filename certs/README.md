# My Private PKI / CA

This is my private Private Key Infrastructure (PKI) / Certificate Authority (CA) for my personal
use. It is used to issue certificates for my own servers and services.

All the private keys are ignored by git, and will be stored in my private secrets repo
[../secrets](../secrets/)
